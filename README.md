# CEN

This repository is the canonical source of truth for the CEN protocol used by CoEpi and CovidWatch.

The current protocol description is contained in [`protocol.md`](./protocol.md).

## Workflow

The `main` branch contains the latest version.  This branch is protected, so
that commits cannot be pushed to it directly.  Instead, changes to the `main`
branch happen through PRs.  This ensures that every spec change has a record
and justification.
